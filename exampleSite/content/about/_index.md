## 32 Years Providing world-class Fraser Fir Christmas Trees and more

We have been involved with North Carolina Fraser Fir Christmas trees for 32 years. We have seen a lot of changes over the years. Yet, through the changes, North Carolina Fraser Firs still stand alone at the top of the tree market. We take pride in the raising of Fraser Fir Christmas trees giving each tree their own special touch. As the tree business is seeming to be taken over by a handful of growers, I still take pride in giving each customer the satisfaction of knowing they’re getting a beautiful Christmas tree each holiday season. We are here for the customer and not the chain stores. It is the customers who ultimately make the chain stores what they are. Whether you buy 100 or 1,000 you’re still #1 to us.
